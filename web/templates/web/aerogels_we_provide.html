                            Advanced aerogel LLC is the exclusive agent of Beijing Hongda Technology Co., Ltd. Mr. Li
                            Guangwu founded the Hongda Polytron Technologies Inc in Beijing in 2013. Mr. Li has
                            developed a patent technology of grading decompression method through long-term research.
                            Compared with the traditional technology, it can reduce the production cost, make the
                            aerogel products with better scale production and better performance, open the door for its
                            wider application in many industries, obtained patents from the United States and other
                            countries as well.<br/>
                            The latest test results of aerogel products are as follows:<br/>
                            Thermal conductivity, w / (m Â· K): 0.013;<br/>
                            Porosity,%: 92;<br/>
                            Density, kg / M: 322;<br/>
                            Hydrophobicity,%: 95;<br/>
                            Surface weight ratio, m2 / G: 960<br/>

                            <br/>
                            The insulation felt series produced by Hongna Luyuan company of our company is another
                            special technology developed by Beijing Hongda Polytron Technologies Inc, making our aerogel
                            insulation blanket much better than other similar products. Traditionally, aerogels are
                            applied to the fiber net by immersing the fabric in the coating solution. Then remove and
                            heat to dry. There are some major quality problems in the products made by this process: the
                            coating will peel off as the blanket is bent or under rain and sunlight, resulting in the
                            decrease of thermal protection effect, and the aerogel insulation blanket needs to be added
                            or replaced. <br/>
                            Our technology uses vacuum negative pressure to absorb aerogels into fiber chips and mix
                            with fibers. This makes our products very different from other products because they hardly
                            peel off and are not easy to age. Therefore, customers can enjoy longer insulation time and
                            save cost without frequent addition or replacement of products.
