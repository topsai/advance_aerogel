                        Aerogel is one of the best new material in the world, which is developed by NASA and applied to
                        commercial use in last couple of decades.<br/><br/>
                        Aerogels are a diverse class of ultralow density solids that combine multiple disparate and
                        extreme materials properties into a single material envelope. Aerogel materials generally
                        exhibit a high degree of porosity, high specific surface area, and superlative energy damping
                        (thermal, acoustic, and impact) properties.<br/><br/>
                        Silica aerogels are a common type of aerogel that combine ultralow thermal conductivity (as low
                        as 10 mW m-1 K-1) with extremely low density (as low as 0.001 g cm-3), high specific surface
                        area (500-2000 m2 g-1), low dielectric constant (as low as 1.02), and good optical transparency
                        (~91% per cm), making them uniquely valuable as high-performance insulators, supports for
                        chemical sensors and catalysts, and particle detectors.

                    Mr. Li spent long time for researching and developed a patented technology to manufacture
                    aerogel in a better and cheaper way, which provides the possibilities for aerogel to using in a
                    varieties of industries.
